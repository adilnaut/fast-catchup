Good morning. TIL there is such a thing as “burrito season.” Chipotle said yesterday it’s hiring 15,000 employees to prep for “burrito season”—the period from March–May that represents its busiest sales stretch on the calendar.

So if we’re getting this right…

March–May: burrito season

June–August: ribs season

September: soup season

October: spooky season

November: Soup Season 2: The Return of the Soup

December–February: cuffing season

ECONOMY

How’s the economy doing? <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7D9ca4ffab> Larry David saying <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczc_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7E9ca4ffab> Curb Your Enthusiasm/HBO via Giphy
Larry David’s favorite tagline also happens to be an apt description of the economy right now: It’s pretty, pretty good.

US gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at a 2.9% annualized pace <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczg_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7C21fb0958> in Q4 2022, which topped expectations. And it’s rock-solid proof that the recession we’ve been warned about for months ain’t here yet.

Not only has the US economy regained <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xczk_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7Cef68ffc0> all the lost output from the Covid recession, but it’s also returned to its growth trajectory from before the pandemic. Real GDP per capita, which factors in inflation, has reached its highest level ever.

Is this a sign of a “soft landing”? Q4’s strong GDP numbers add fuel to the argument that the Fed could actually pull off the tricky “soft landing”—where it knocks down inflation through interest rate hikes without sending economic growth into reverse. The resilient labor market is cooperating: Despite all the headlines about layoffs, jobless claims fell last week to their lowest point since April 2022.

But don’t write off a recession just yet

Economists combing through the GDP report found a few warning signs that indicate a recession remains a clear and present danger. Here are a few:

Consumers are pulling back. Personal consumption, which represents about 70% of all US output, came in below forecasts, signaling Americans aren’t reaching for their wallets like they had been earlier in the pandemic. Growth in business inventories also suggest a more cautious consumer.

The housing market got pummeled. The sector shrank at a 27% annualized pace last quarter as higher mortgage rates put home-buying and construction on ice.

Companies are slowing down their spending. In Q3, business investment grew 6.2%; in Q4, just 0.7%.

Bottom line: The US economy is in a fluid state right now, being tugged in different directions by large, complex forces. Even the people who study it 50 hours a week only speak in probabilities (e.g., “there’s an X% chance Y will happen”). When execs and economists say the outlook is “uncertain”—they mean it.—NF

Big picture: SmarterChild 2.0’s success has educators debating AI’s role in the classroom and how to best assess student learning in the new ChatGPT era.

“If you sue me, I’m not going to let you see Billy Joel live.”

That’s essentially how James Dolan, the CEO of Madison Square Garden Entertainment and billionaire owner of the Knicks, defended <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xc28_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7C6a3658b1> the company’s controversial use of facial recognition at its venues.

In a rare TV interview yesterday, Dolan claimed that “the Garden has to defend itself,” and threatened to halt alcohol sales at Rangers hockey games to generate negative publicity for regulators. “I don’t need the liquor,” he said.

What’s Dolan so riled up about? Remember when an attorney was escorted <https://link.morningbrew.com/click/30373516.1557191/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rcy5tb3JuaW5nYnJldy5jb20vYy8xc3A_bWlkPTc3NTEzOTIxYzZkYjgxOWVkZDQyMGVmZGM1YzgyNzQ2JmNpZD0zMDM3MzUxNi4xNTU3MTkx/60cc134ee9902d6af67208d7Cbf3df0e3> out of Radio City Music Hall while attempting to see the Rockettes with her daughter? It’s about that—and broader backlash over MSG’s alleged practice of using facial recognition tech to identify and ban lawyers employed at firms involved in MSG-related cases from entering its venues.

New York has launched an investigation into MSG’s use of facial recognition tech, which has impacted 90 law firms, according to NY Attorney General Letitia James.

<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px"><strong style="color:#000">Is this a sign of a “soft landing”? </strong>Q4’s strong GDP numbers are raising hopes that the Fed could actually pull off the tricky “soft landing”—where it knocks down inflation through interest rate hikes without sending economic growth into reverse. The resilient labor market is cooperating: Despite all the headlines about layoffs, jobless claims fell last week to their lowest point since April 2022.</p>

<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px">Economists combing through the GDP report found a few warning signs that indicate a recession remains a clear and present danger. Here are a few:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0;padding-left:30px">
<li style="line-height:22px;margin-bottom:10px">
<span><strong style="color:#000">Consumers are pulling back. </strong></span><span>Personal consumption, which represents about 70% of all US output, came in below forecasts, signaling Americans aren’t reaching for their wallets like they had been earlier in the pandemic. Growth in business inventories also suggest a more cautious consumer.</span>
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;margin-bottom:10px">
<span><strong style="color:#000">The housing market got pummeled. </strong></span><span>The sector shrank at a 27% annualized pace last quarter as higher mortgage rates put homebuying and construction on ice.</span>
</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;margin-bottom:10px">
<span><strong style="color:#000">Companies are slowing down their spending.</strong></span><span> In Q3, business investment grew 6.2%; in Q4, just 0.7%.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height:22px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:15px"><strong style="color:#000">Bottom line: </strong>The US economy is in a fluid state right now, being tugged in different directions by large, complex forces. And even the people who study it 50+ hours a week only speak in probabilities. When execs and economists say the outlook is “uncertain”—they mean it.—<em>NF</em></p>
