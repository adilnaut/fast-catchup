A $1.5 million Tennessee mansion went viral this week…despite its Zillow listing using a photo of it literally on fire. And in case you were wondering if buying homes is still hard: It’s already under contract .
The hopeful buyer, Mike Thakur, plans to vlog his restoration process, riding the property’s wave of internet virality and milking that charred house for as much content as possible.
The burnt home…sits on almost five acres of land in Franklin, TN, and includes a bunch of grand staircases, an outdoor kitchen, and a detached guesthouse—where Thakur and his family will live while they fix up the main manor. The house had a fire in September that caused significant damage, but in 2020 (pre-fire) it sold for $10 million, according to a press release from Newswires.
We don’t know how much the self-described content creator/serial entrepreneur is paying for the house, but it was only listed last Tuesday and had a lot of interest from potential buyers, according to the realtors.
Big picture: There’s also growing interest in non-burned down homes. Redfin data found that pending house sales in the US rose 3% last month, the first increase since October 2021. After a tumultuous year, housing demand seems to be rising slowly from the ashes.—MM
